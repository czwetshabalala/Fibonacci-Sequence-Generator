# 🔢*Fibonacci Sequence Generator* 
## a Fibonacci sequence generator implemented across *Python*, *C++*, as well as *Java*.
The fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers such that each term is a sum of the previous two terms in the series. The first two terms in the sequence are ,0 and 1, form the foundation on which the sequence is built on.The generator uses an iterative approach(mainly while loops) to generate the sequence as it is generally faster than the recursive alternative.<br/>

### Class Methods and Key Features: 
Each implementation provides a Fib() object/class with following methods for the user to interact with: <br/>

*setLast(int)*: Set the number of terms to generate in the sequence. <br/> <br/>
*calculateSequence()*: Generates the sequence iteratively. <br/> <br/>
*displaySequence()* : Displays the generated sequence as a string. <br/> <br/>
*search(int n)*: Allows the user to search the generated sequence for a value. <br/> <br/>
*~Fib()*: The destructor deallocates all memory used up by the object. <br/> <br/>
