# Fibonacci-Sequence-Generator
## The repo contains the code for a Fibonacci sequence generator implemented across *Python*, *C++*, as well as *Java*.
The fibonacci sequence is a series of number that is generated by adding the previous two numbers. This program is an implementation of this sequence using while loops. <br/>
### How the code works: 

The code allows the user to enter the the amount of terms to calculate in the fibonacci sequence. <br/>

This is done by creating a fibonacci with two variabes <br/>
1. last variable - the number of terms to generate <br/>
2. An integer array to store the terms that are generated in the sequence.
