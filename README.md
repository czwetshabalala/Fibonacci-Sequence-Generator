# Fibonacci-Sequence-Generator
## This repo contains the code for a Fibonacci sequence generator implemented in *Python*, *C++*, as well as *Java*.
The fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers such that each number is a sum of the previous two numbers in the series. The first two numebrs in the sequence are 0 and 1 which form the foundation of which the sequence is built from. This program is an implementation of this sequence using while loops. <br/>
### How the code works: 

The code allows the user to create a fibonacci object and enter in how many terms in the sequence they want to generate. <br/>

The object allows the users to: <br/>
  1. Create a fibonacci sequence generator object <br/>
  2. Initialise the the amount of terms you want to generate <br/>
  3. Calculate the terms in the sequence. <br/>
  4. Display the sequence. <br/>
